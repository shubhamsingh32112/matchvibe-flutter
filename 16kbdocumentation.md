Support 16 KB page sizes

16 KB Google Play compatibility requirement
Starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing apps submitted to Google Play and targeting Android 15+ devices must support 16 KB page sizes on 64-bit devices.
Read More →

Historically, Android has only supported 4 KB memory page sizes, which has optimized system memory performance for the average amount of total memory that Android devices have typically had. Beginning with Android 15, AOSP supports devices that are configured to use a page size of 16 KB (16 KB devices). If your app uses any NDK libraries, either directly or indirectly through an SDK, then you will need to rebuild your app for it to work on these 16 KB devices.

As device manufacturers continue to build devices with larger amounts of physical memory (RAM), many of these devices will adopt 16 KB (and eventually greater) page sizes to optimize the device's performance. Adding support for 16 KB page size devices enables your app to run on these devices and helps your app benefit from the associated performance improvements. Without recompiling, apps won't work on 16 KB devices in future Android releases.

To help you add support for your app, we've provided guidance on how to check if your app is impacted, how to rebuild your app (if applicable), and how to test your app in a 16 KB environment using emulators (including Android 15 system images for the Android Emulator).

Benefits and performance gains
Devices configured with 16 KB page sizes use slightly more memory on average, but also gain various performance improvements for both the system and apps:

Lower app launch times while the system is under memory pressure: 3.16% lower on average, with more significant improvements (up to 30%) for some apps that we tested
Reduced power draw during app launch: 4.56% reduction on average
Faster camera launch: 4.48% faster hot starts on average, and 6.60% faster cold starts on average
Improved system boot time: improved by 8% (approximately 950 milliseconds) on average
These improvements are based on our initial testing, and results on actual devices will likely differ. We'll provide additional analysis of potential gains for apps as we continue our testing.

Check if your app is impacted
If your app uses any native code, then you should rebuild your app with support for 16 KB devices. If you are unsure if your app uses native code, you can use the APK Analyzer to identify whether any native code is present and then check the alignment of ELF segments for any shared libraries that you find. Android Studio also provides features that help you to automatically detect alignment issues.

If your app only uses code written in the Java programming language or in Kotlin, including all libraries or SDKs, then your app already supports 16 KB devices. Nevertheless, we recommend that you test your app in a 16 KB environment to verify that there are no unexpected regressions in app behavior.

Does your app use native code?
Your app makes use of native code if any of the following apply:

Your app uses any C/C++ (native) code. If your app uses the Android NDK, then your app uses native code.
Your app links with any third-party native libraries or dependencies (such as SDKs) that use them.
Your app is built by a third-party app builder that uses native libraries on device.
Identify native libraries using APK Analyzer
APK Analyzer is a tool that lets you evaluate various aspects of a built APK. To check whether your app uses native code (regardless of whether it is 16 KB compatible):

Open Android Studio, then click File > Open and choose any project.
From the menu bar, click Build > Analyze APK...

Studio Build menu option to launch APK Analyzer
Choose the APK you want to analyze.

Look within the lib folder, which hosts shared object (.so) files if any are present. If any shared object files are present, your app uses native code. The Alignment column displays warning messages for any files that have alignment issues. If no shared object files are present or there is no lib folder, then your app doesn't use native code.

Detect alignment issues with automated checks
Android Studio warns you proactively if your prebuilt libraries or APKs aren't 16 KB compliant. Use the APK Analyzer tool to review which libraries need to be updated or if any code changes are required.

Studio warning notifications about alignment issues in a project
Lint in Android Studio also highlights native libraries that aren't 16 KB aligned.

Check the alignment of ELF segments for shared libraries
For any shared libraries, verify that the shared libraries' ELF segments are aligned properly using 16 KB ELF alignment. If you are developing on either Linux or macOS, you can use the check_elf_alignment.sh script as described in the following section. You can also use the command-line tools directly.

Use the check_elf_alignment.sh script (Linux or macOS)
Follow these steps to check the alignment of ELF segments using the check_elf_alignment.sh script:

Save the check_elf_alignment.sh script to a file.

Run the script on your app's APK file:


check_elf_alignment.sh APK_NAME.apk
The script outputs either ALIGNED or UNALIGNED for all the arm64-v8a shared libraries.

If any arm64-v8a or x86_64 shared libraries are UNALIGNED, you'll need to update the packaging for those libraries, then recompile your app and retest by following the steps in this section.

Use command-line tools directly
Follow these steps to check the alignment of ELF segments using command-line tools directly:

Make sure both Android SDK Build-Tools version 35.0.0 or higher and the Android NDK are installed using the SDK Manager in Android Studio or sdkmanager command-line tool.
Extract your app's APK file:

Linux or macOS
Windows (PowerShell)

unzip APK_NAME.apk -d /tmp/my_apk_out
In the temporary directory that you extracted your APK file to, check the contents of the lib directory for shared object (.so) files. These are the same shared object files that you would've seen while identifying native libraries using APK Analyzer. Run the following command on each shared object file:

Linux or macOS
Windows (PowerShell)

SDK_ROOT_LOCATION/Android/sdk/ndk/NDK_VERSION/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/llvm-objdump -p SHARED_OBJECT_FILE.so | grep LOAD
Where SDK_ROOT_LOCATION is the path to the directory where you've installed the Android SDK, SHARED_OBJECT_FILE is the name of the shared object file that you're checking, and NDK_VERSION is the version of the Android NDK that you have installed (for example, 28.0.12433566). The output will look something like the following for each file you check:


LOAD off    0x0000000000000000 vaddr 0x0000000000000000 paddr 0x0000000000000000 align 2**14
LOAD off    0x0000000000042a90 vaddr 0x0000000000043a90 paddr 0x0000000000043a90 align 2**14
LOAD off    0x0000000000046230 vaddr 0x0000000000048230 paddr 0x0000000000048230 align 2**14
Check the output lines to ensure that the load segments don't have values less than 2**14. If any load segments are 2**13, 2**12, or lower values, you'll need to update the packaging for those libraries, then recompile your app and retest by following the steps in this section.

Next, run the zipalign command-line tool on your app's APK file:

Linux or macOS
Windows (PowerShell)

SDK_ROOT_LOCATION/Android/sdk/build-tools/35.0.0/zipalign -v -c -P 16 4 APK_NAME.apk
Where SDK_ROOT_LOCATION is the path to the directory where you've installed the Android SDK, and APK_NAME is the name of your app's APK file. The last line of the output will say "Verification successful" if all of the shared libraries are aligned correctly.

If the verification failed, some shared libraries need to be realigned, so you'll need to update the packaging for those libraries, then recompile your app and retest by following the steps in this section.

Build your app with support for 16 KB devices
If your app uses native code, then complete the steps that are outlined in the following sections to make sure that your app supports 16 KB devices:

Update the packaging of your shared libraries
Compile your app using 16 KB ELF alignment
Fix code and resolve runtime issues
Check SDKs for 16 KB support
Tip: If you update your tools to the latest versions (AGP version 8.5.1 or higher and NDK version r28 or higher) and use 16 KB-compatible prebuilt dependencies, then your app is 16 KB compatible by default and you can skip to the step for fixing code and resolving runtime issues.
Update the packaging of your shared libraries
Upgrade to AGP version 8.5.1 or higher and use uncompressed shared libraries.

Use bundletool to verify zip alignment
To see the alignment of your bundle, use:


bundletool dump config --bundle=<my .aab>  | grep alignment
If you see PAGE_ALIGNMENT_16K then you know your bundle requests 16 KB zip alignment. If you see PAGE_ALIGNMENT_4K, this instructs the APK built from this AAB to have 4 KB aligned .so files in the zip file.

AGP version 8.5.1 or higher
16 KB devices require apps that ship with uncompressed shared libraries to align them on a 16 KB zip-aligned boundary. To do this, you need to upgrade to Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version 8.5.1 or higher. Refer to the Android Gradle plugin Upgrade Assistant section for details on the upgrade process.

AGP version 8.5 or lower
Note: In AGP version 8.3 to 8.5, apps are 16 KB aligned by default. However, bundletool does not zipalign APKs by default. So, the app may appear to work, but when built from a bundle in Play, it won't install.
If you can't upgrade AGP to version 8.5.1 or higher, then the alternative is to switch to use compressed shared libraries. Update your Gradle configuration to have Gradle compress your shared libraries when packaging your app to avoid app installation issues with unaligned shared libraries.

Groovy
Kotlin
In your build.gradle file, add the following option:


android {
  ...
  packagingOptions {
      jniLibs {
        useLegacyPackaging true
      }
  }
}
Warning: When you use compressed shared libraries, your app takes up more space when installed, as libraries are extracted from the APK and copied onto disk. Your app might more frequently fail to install because this increase in disk usage means there is less space on device. To avoid this, upgrade to AGP version 8.5.1 or higher.
Compile your app using 16 KB ELF alignment
16 KB devices require the shared libraries' ELF segments to be aligned properly using 16 KB ELF alignment in order for your app to run.

For game developers, if your game runs on top of Unity game engine, refer to the Unity guide. If your game runs on top of Unreal game engine, refer to the Unreal guide. For native game engines, continue with this guide.

Note: If your app doesn't extract native libraries to the file system (extractNativeLibs set to false), you'll likely notice a slight increase in your app's binary size after compiling using a 16 KB ELF alignment. Optimizations to the package manager in Android 15 negate the runtime costs from this increase.
To compile your app using 16 KB ELF alignment, complete the steps in one of the following sections depending on the version of the Android NDK that you're using.

Important: If your app uses any prebuilt shared libraries, you must also recompile them in the same way and reimport the 16 KB-aligned libraries into your app.
Android NDK r28 and higher
NDK version r28 and higher compile 16 KB-aligned by default.

Android NDK r27

To support compiling 16 KB-aligned shared libraries with Android NDK version r27 and higher, you need to update your ndk-build, build.gradle, build.gradle.kts, or linker flags as follows:

ndk-build
Groovy
Kotlin
Other build systems
In your Application.mk:


APP_SUPPORT_FLEXIBLE_PAGE_SIZES := true
Android NDK r26 and lower
Always update your NDK. This should only be used as a last resort, and no support is guaranteed.

To support compiling 16 KB-aligned shared libraries with Android NDK version r26 or lower, you need to update your ndk-build or cmake configuration as follows:

ndk-build
CMake
Update your Android.mk to enable 16 KB ELF alignment:


LOCAL_LDFLAGS += "-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384"
Android NDK r22 and lower is not compatible
Always update your NDK. This should only be used as a last resort, and no support is guaranteed.

In addition to steps for NDK r26 and lower, common-page-size=16384 can workaround bugs in old GNU ld and LLVM lld linkers. This only works if the ELF also has present a .relro_padding section. This depends on the version of the linker and the specific program that is written. There is no support for these NDK versions, and if it does not work, update the NDK version before reporting any issue.

Note: Even if your app dynamically links to the C++ standard library (libc++_shared.so) from NDKs r26 and lower, some of which don't have a 16 KB aligned libc++_shared.so, you should still update the alignment of all other libraries here, and you should update your code to avoid depending on PAGE_SIZE. In order to test on those lower versions of the NDK on 16 KB devices, canary releases of LTS NDK versions r23 and r25 are available on Android CI with 16 KB aligned libc++_shared.so libraries.
Note: If you can't move to the newer Android NDK, then you might be able to update your app to statically compile the C++ standard library into your shared library. Refer to the C++ Library Support section for details on statically linking to the C++ standard library and be sure to read the Important Considerations section.
Fix code and resolve runtime issues
Even if your app is 16 KB-aligned, your app can encounter errors if places in your code assume that a device is using a specific page size. To avoid this, complete the following steps:

Remove any hard-coded dependencies that reference the PAGE_SIZE constant or instances in your code logic that assume that a device's page size is 4 KB (4096).

Use getpagesize() or sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) instead.

Look for usages of mmap() and other APIs that require page-aligned arguments and replace with alternatives where necessary.

In some cases, if your app uses PAGE_SIZE as a convenient value that isn't tied to the underlying page size, then this won't cause your app to break when used in 16 KB mode. However, if this value is passed to the kernel with mmap without MAP_FIXED, the kernel still uses an entire page, which wastes some memory. For these reasons, PAGE_SIZE is undefined when 16 KB mode is enabled on NDK r27 and higher.

If your app uses PAGE_SIZE in this way and never directly passes this value to the kernel, then instead of using PAGE_SIZE, create a new variable with a new name to reflect that it is used for other purposes and does not reflect a real memory page.

Check SDKs for 16 KB support
Many SDKs are compatible with 16 KB page sizes, especially if you build them yourself or get recent prebuilts. However, because some SDK prebuilts or SDK versions aren't 16 KB compatible, you should check the website for each SDK provider to determine which version to use with 16 KB.

Test your app in a 16 KB environment
After you build your app with support for 16 KB devices, you'll want to test your app in a 16 KB environment to see whether your app experiences any regressions. To do this, follow these steps:

Set up the Android 15 SDK or higher.

Set up one of the following testing environments:

Set up the Android Emulator with a 16 KB–based, Android 15 system image
Use Cuttlefish with 16 KB page size on ARM64
Simulate Cuttlefish with 16 KB page size on x86-64
Enable 16 KB mode on a device using developer options
Use Samsung Remote Test Lab on 16 KB supported devices
Start up your test device, then run the following command to verify that it's using a 16 KB environment:


adb shell getconf PAGE_SIZE
The command should return a value of 16384.

Run the following zipalign command to verify that your app is 16 KB-aligned, where APK_NAME is the name of your app's APK file:


zipalign -c -P 16 -v 4 APK_NAME.apk
Thoroughly test your app, focusing on any areas that might be affected by changing code instances that reference specific page sizes.

Set up the Android Emulator with a 16-KB-based system image
To set up a 16 KB environment using the Android Emulator, follow these steps:

In Android Studio, click Tools > SDK Manager.
In the SDK Platforms tab, check Show Package Details, then expand the Android VanillaIceCream or higher section and select one or both of the following emulator system images, depending on the virtual devices you want to create:

Google APIs Experimental 16 KB Page Size ARM 64 v8a System Image
Google APIs Experimental 16 KB Page Size Intel x86_64 Atom System Image
Note: If you're planning to emulate a supported Google Pixel device, you will only need the ARM 64 v8a System Image.
Download 16 KB emulator system images using the SDK Manager in
  Android Studio
Click Apply > OK to download whichever system images you selected.

Follow the steps to set up a virtual device for Android 15, and when prompted to select a system image, select the 16 KB system image that you downloaded. If it's not recommended automatically, you can find the 16 KB system image in the Other Images tab.

Find the 16 KB emulator image in the Other Images tab
Launch the emulator
After you finish setting up the Android Emulator and virtual devices, launch the emulator from the target device menu, or from the command line.

Enable 16 KB mode on a device using developer options

Toggle the Boot with 16KB page size developer option to boot a device in 16 KB mode.

In QPR versions of Android 15, you can use the developer option that's available on certain devices to boot the device in 16 KB mode and perform on-device testing. Before using the developer option, go to Settings > System > Software updates and apply any updates that are available.

This developer option is available on the following devices:

Pixel 8 and 8 Pro (with Android 15 QPR1 or higher)

Pixel 8a (with Android 15 QPR1 or higher)

Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL (with Android 15 QPR2 or higher)

Pixel 9a (with Android 16 or higher)

16 KB backcompat mode
Warning in page size compat mod
Warning in page size compat mode

The 16 KB backcompat option is available when a device is running with a 16 KB kernel. The package manager runs an app in 16 KB backcompat mode when the following conditions are met:

If the app has ELF files (with an .so extension) with a LOAD segment alignment of 4 KB.
If the zipped APK has uncompressed ELF files that are 4 KB ZIP aligned.
If the package manager has enabled 16 KB backcompat mode for an app, the app displays a warning when it's first launched saying that it's running in 16 KB backcompat mode.

16 KB backcompat mode allows some apps to work, but for best reliability and stability, apps should still be 16 KB aligned.

On the app info page, under Advanced, toggle the setting Run app with page size compat mode to enable or disable the 16 KB backcompat mode for specific app. This setting is visible only when the device is running with 16 KB page size.

Page size compat mode setting

Page size compat mode setting

To force 16 KB backcompat on for every app on the device:


adb shell setprop bionic.linker.16kb.app_compat.enabled true
adb shell setprop pm.16kb.app_compat.disabled false
To force 16 KB backcompat off for every app on the device:


adb shell setprop bionic.linker.16kb.app_compat.enabled false
adb shell setprop pm.16kb.app_compat.disabled true
In Android 17, you can also force 16 KB backcompat off for every app and cause any incompatible binary to immediately abort:


    adb shell setprop bionic.linker.16kb.app_compat.enabled fatal
    adb shell setprop pm.16kb.app_compat.disabled true
Set the android:pageSizeCompat property to enabled or disabled to turn on or off backcompat mode for a specific app in its AndroidManifest.xml. When this property is set, the app won't display backcompat mode warnings when it launches.

Google Play compatibility requirement
As device manufacturers equip devices with more RAM to optimize performance, many will adopt larger page sizes like 16 KB. To prepare for the launch of these upcoming devices, Google Play is introducing a new compatibility requirement: starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing apps submitted to Google Play and targeting devices running Android 15 (API level 35) and higher must support 16 KB page sizes.

To read more about this compatibility requirement, see this blog post.

Google Play empowers you to manage and distribute your innovative and trusted apps and games to billions of users around the world across the entire breadth of Android devices, and historically, all Android devices have managed memory in 4 KB pages.

As device manufacturers equip devices with more RAM to optimize performance, many will adopt larger page sizes like 16 KB. Android 15 introduces support for the increased page size, ensuring your app can run on these evolving devices and benefit from the associated performance gains.

Starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing apps submitted to Google Play and targeting Android 15+ devices must support 16 KB page sizes.
This is a key technical requirement to ensure your users can benefit from the performance enhancements on newer devices and prepares your apps for the platform's future direction of improved performance on newer hardware. Without recompiling to support 16 KB pages, your app might not function correctly on these devices when they become more widely available in future Android releases.

We’ve seen that 16 KB can help with:

Faster app launches: See improvements ranging from 3% to 30% for various apps.
Improved battery usage: Experience an average gain of 4.5%.
Quicker camera starts: Launch the camera 4.5% to 6.6% faster.
Speedier system boot-ups: Boot Android devices approximately 8% faster.
We recommend checking your apps early especially for dependencies that might not yet be 16 KB compatible. Many popular SDK providers, like React Native and Flutter, already offer compatible versions. For game developers, several leading game engines, such as Unity, support 16 KB, with support for Unreal Engine coming soon.

Reaching 16 KB compatibility
A substantial number of apps are already compatible, so your app may already work seamlessly with this requirement. For most of those that need to make adjustments, we expect the changes to be minimal.

Apps with no native code should be compatible without any changes at all.
Apps using libraries or SDKs that contain native code may need to update these to a compatible version.
Apps with native code may need to recompile with a more recent toolchain and check for any code with incompatible low level memory management.
Our December blog post, Get your apps ready for 16 KB page size devices, provides a more detailed technical explanation and guidance on how to prepare your apps.

Check your app's compatibility now
It's easy to see if your app bundle already supports 16 KB memory page sizes. Visit the app bundle explorer page in Play Console to check your app's build compliance and get guidance on where your app may need updating.


App bundle explorer in Play Console

Beyond the app bundle explorer, make sure to also test your app in a 16 KB environment. This will help you ensure users don’t experience any issues and that your app delivers its best performance.

For more information, check out the full documentation.

Thank you for your continued support in bringing delightful, fast, and high-performance experiences to users across the breadth of devices Play supports. We look forward to seeing the enhanced experiences you'll deliver with 16 KB support.
